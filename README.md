# FitMe: Stitch Smart. Dress Smarter. 
FitMe is a **fashion utility web application** that helps users plan, estimate, and personalize their outfits.  
It provides interactive tools like a **Fabric Estimator**, **Outfit Recommender**, **Explore by State**, **Tailor Mode**, and a **Nearby Tailor Finder**, making it easier to stitch and style smarter.
